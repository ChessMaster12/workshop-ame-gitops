# 7. Configure Grafana

Using [Grafana](https://grafana.avisi.cloud) you are able to view the metrics and log events generated within your cluster. At this time, we do not automatically configure your Grafana instance to work with newly created clusters (this is on our roadmap).

By creating access tokens for your Observability data, you are able to configure Grafana with a new datasource to gain insight into your cluster.

## Tasks

- Find Observability configuration for your cluster
- Create access Token for Grafana Datasource
- Add Grafana Datasource
- View Dashboards in Grafana
