# 10. Cluster lifecycle

Clusters can be stopped, started and deleted after their initial creation. You will now stop your cluster, start it again and finally destroy it.

## Tasks

- Stop your cluster. Observe the activity events in the [Console](https://console.avisi.cloud).
- Confirm you are no longer able to access your cluster through `kubectl`, nor using the hostname from the loadbalancer you previously used in assignment `6`.
- Start your cluster again. Once started, confirm you can use all resources again.
- Now you can destroy your cluster.
